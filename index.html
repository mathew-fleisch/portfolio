          <p class="mb-5">My name is Mathew Fleisch, I am a Full Stack, Senior Infrastructure/DevOps Engineer from San Francisco. I love working on new projects and features, and often times, this means fixing and retrofitting existing products first. Every development team I have worked for, from non-profits to Apple, have all had a finite amount of resources, whether that is infrastructure or developer time. Throughout my career, I have lived by <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?LazinessImpatienceHubris" target="_blank">Larry Wall's philosophy</a> and will automate as much as possible, adopting DevOps principles before there was such a title/role. I try to automate any task, if myself, or another coworker must repeat that task more than once. If a task requires human input, I will create a tool or UI that can allow someone closer to the data, to maintain it. This philosophy frees up developer time and reduces the amount of communication necessary to complete common tasks within the organization. I am also a firm believer that building stable CI/CD pipelines increases developer velocity and coupled with adequate testing coverage, can increase confidence in secure, scalable production code.<br /><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/automateallthethings" target="_blank">#AutomateAllTheThings</a></p>

              <div class="subheading mb-3"><span class="text-primary bolder">Sysdig</span> · Feb 2020 - Present</div>
              <p>I work on developer tools in the infrastructure team at Sysdig, to increase developer velocity and productivity. Apart from participating in the on-call rotation for a multi-cloud, multi-region monitoring application, I have helped to migrate, upgrade and stabilize existing tools, and create a few of my own.</p>
              <p>One of my first projects, was to migrate an on-prem installation of artifactory/jfrog from an ec2/docker/ebs setup to kubernetes/s3/velero. Upgrading to the latest version of artifactory, copying 1TB of artifacts to a new system, while developers continued to use the service, was challenging to coordinate; however, the outcome was successful, and unnoticed by most developers. This change was driven by cost, as the size and number of artifacts grew, the expensive aws-ebs volume had to scale as well. Using an s3 bucket for storage makes the potential artifact storage "unlimited," but required upgrading to the latest version to be a supported feature. I created scripts to copy the data from the ebs volumes to s3, verify parity, and practiced to ensure the migration would be unnoticed.</p>
              <p>Though Sysdig is primarily a jenkins shop, I have created a number of automations with GitHub Actions to plan/apply terraform, build docker containers, and entire Kops clusters, using GitOps principles. After creating "self-hosted" GitHub Action runners, I created a pipeline that would spin up a kops cluster, deploy a secondary gh-action runner, and use that secondary runner to deploy the full Sysdig stack; all triggered by merging to the main branch of a repository. These "on-demand" environments get route53 cnames to expose the web UI on a subdomain tied to a slack username, and kube-config is also made available for developers to access the cluster via kubectl. <a href="#bashbot">BashBot</a>, an open-source slack bot I wrote, helps to extend the GitOps style pipeline, by triggering creation/deletion of environments, in slack. Developers type `bashbot dod-build` to create an on-demand development environment, and `bashbot dod-destroy` to tear it down.</p>

              While on the infrastructure team, we built reusable terraform to replace the legacy, snowflake dev/stage/prod environments. This allowed us to create on-demand environments for the developers to have their own personal sandboxes. These on-demand environments are decorated with tools and tests, to simulate load conditions, and have the controls/levers that operations staff would use in production. Developers are able to provision, destroy, and deploy branches, to their own environments, using the chatops bot I wrote (<a href="#bashbot">read more about BashBot</a>). The bot triggers a circleci job, that builds the infrastructure via terraform in about an hour. Before I left, I was in the process of training my team to port the exiting codedeploy/ec2 portion of our pipeline, to kubernetes/helm.</p>

            BashBot uses a json configuration file to define custom commands. Written in golang, BashBot uses slack's real-time-messaging api (RTM) to parse each message via regular expressions. If a command is detected and matched to an entry in the configuration file, bash commands are executed pertaining to that entry. Sensitive commands can be restricted to private channels, within the configuration file, and members of that private channel can execute that restricted command. This allows infrastructure teams to quickly port the internal tools they create, into version controlled slack commands, and broaden adoption to other coworkers in the organization. An organization can clone the <a href="https://github.com/mathew-fleisch/bashbot" target="_blank">source</a>, download a <a href="https://github.com/mathew-fleisch/bashbot/releases" target="_blank">tarball</a>, or use a pre-built <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/mathewfleisch/bashbot" target="_blank">container via docker-hub</a> to run BashBot in a varity of different environments. <br /><br /></li>

            This idea came from a hackathon project I started at Eaze with a Raspberry Pi+camera. The SF Eaze office currently looks over the ferry terminal, on the Embarcadero and I thought the fog and boats would be cool to see as a time lapse. Images are captured at 1fps and stored in an s3 bucket, using the date/timestamp as the filename. A processing pipeline pulls the images down in a circleci container, runs ffmpeg to make a video, and then speeds it up to match a random mp3.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCg_RROW8rUh89sWqGaJ8Llg" target="_blank">YouTube Channel</a><br /><strong>Example:</strong><br /><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/un9X0gUwX0I" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><br /><br /></li>

            One of the unique aspects of the DEF CON conference is third-party badges that are essentially circuit boards with LEDs and screens on them. One badge has an LED matrix and an accelerometer sensor. I used the on-board interface via a serial connection to port the game Tetris to that platform in Python. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/u1zjQc9.mp4" target="_blank">This video</a> shows Tetris in action.<br /><br /></li>

            A video podcast I've subscribed to for over ten years also sells penetration testing equipment through their website. One of their products, BashBunny, combines a keyboard simulator with an arm chip running linux via USB. This allows penetration testers to script the kind of intrusion and/or exfiltration attacks, with physical access to a target computer. I have written two payloads for this device: <a href="https://github.com/hak5/bashbunny-payloads/tree/master/payloads/library/general/GitBunnyGit" target="_blank">GitBunnyGit</a>  and <a href="https://github.com/hak5/bashbunny-payloads/tree/master/payloads/library/exfiltration/TwoStageMac" target="_blank">TwoStageMac</a>. GitBunnyGit streamlines the process of installing and updating all other open-source payloads, by running git commands directly on the device. The TwoStageMac payload utilizes the BashBunny's ability to copy files to the target computer to run a malicious script. The sample second stage payload does some basic profiling and is intended to be swapped out for the penetration tester's own second stage.<br /><br /></li>

          <strong>Programming Challenges</strong>
          <ul>
            <li class="list-item">html crawler -> api -> ui (javascript) · <a href="https://github.com/mathew-fleisch/def-con-schedule" target="_blank">source</a> · <a href="https://mathew-fleisch.github.io/def-con-schedule/" target="_blank">demo</a><br />
            This project was sparked by attending DEF CON and not liking the given interface for the conference schedule. I wrote this tool to scrape the conference website for data, and then display that data in a more effecient way.<br /><br /></li>
            <li class="list-item">NPM Top X Package Downloader (javascript) · <a href="https://github.com/mathew-fleisch/homework-node" target="_blank">source</a><br />
            This programming challenge was to scrape a website, and download packages based on data, found on the pages.<br /><br /></li>
            <li class="list-item">Secure URL Shortener (php) · <a href="https://github.com/mathew-fleisch/Link-Shrinker" target="_blank">source</a><br />
            This programming challenge was to create a link shortener, like bit.ly. The added hurdle was to pass links through the https://www.phishtank.com/ api. It comes with a vagrant environment, and runs apache workbench load tests.

            <li class="list-item">Morse Code Game (arduino/c) · <a href="https://github.com/mathew-fleisch/TheHelloWorldMorseCodeGame" target="_blank">source</a><br />
            This program uses Sparkfun's ProtoSnap board or other Arduino board with a button, buzzer, and rgb led attached to the specified pins. The concept of the program is to input morse code via a button, have a function encode, then decode a sequence of 1-5 button presses into an english character. The letter is then printed to the serial monitor and a green light blips, if a character is correctly identified; a red light blips and an error is printed to the serial monitor, if no match was found. To make game around only using the board, a user can spell "hello world" and a different tone will play, as well as a chromatic- like tone-blips as each letter is spelled correctly. If the user spells the target word (target because you the programmer, can change "hello world" to any other string of chars) incorrectly, they have to start at the beginning of the game, with the first letter.<br /><br />
